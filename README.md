## Project Motivation


For this project, I was interested in using Airbnb Los Angeles data to better understand
-  What factors effect price of the unit?
-  Does the price change based on season?
-  What factors effect occupancy ratio(days_occupied/total_days) of the unit?
-  What factors effect review score of the unit?

I was interested in Los Angeles Airbnb data to see what contributes to and predicts price, occupancy ratio(days_occupied/total_days), and review score.  In 2017, Los Angeles was home to over 4 million people and consists of a diverse range of socioeconomic levels.
